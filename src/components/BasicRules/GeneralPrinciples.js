      <h2>How to play</h2>
      <p>
        A game of 40k BA is played between 2 players, each commanding an army of
        around 50 models organized into units. A game consists of 6 turns where
        each turn the players alternate giving orders to their units and then
        resolving those orders. At the end of the game the winner is determined
        by tallying destroyed enemy units and a potential bonus depending on if
        a scenario was played.
      </p>
      <h2>Models</h2>
      <p>
        A model is a miniature mounted on a base.The game is model agnostic but
        base specific. The base a model is to be mounted on is specified in its
        profile.
      </p>
      <h3>Model Interpretation</h3>
      <p>
        Only the base of a model is ever used for measurements and a model is
        considered to occupy the entirety of the base. No model bases may
        overlap or otherwise be placed on top of another.
      </p>
      <h2>Units</h2>
      <p>
        A unit is a model or a group of models that receive and carry out orders
        together.
      </p>
      <h3>Unit Cohesion</h3>
      <p>A Unit is considered Cohesive if all of the following is fulfilled</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The units models form either a single clump or line formation</li>
        <li>
          All models are within 1" of at least one other model in the unit
        </li>
        <li>All models are within 6" in all other models of the unit</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Armies</h2>
      <p>
        An army consists of a number of units fighting together. A unit treats
        all other units in its army as friendly units.
      </p>
      <hr />
      <h2>Measuring Distances</h2>
      <p>
        Distances and ranges are measured in inches. Distance between 2 models
        are measured from the closest point of their respective bases. Players
        are allowed to measure any distance at any time.
      </p>
      <h2>Line of Sight</h2>
      <p>
        Whether a model can see another model depends on if it has Line of Sight
        to that model. Line of Sight is determined by whether an unobscured
        straight line can be drawn from any point of the models base to any
        point of that other models base. Things like some terrain features or
        vehicles can interrupt Line of Sight and obscure models from view.
      </p>
      <h2>Dice</h2>
      <p>
        40k Bolt Action uses six sided dice, referred to as D6, that are rolled
        giving a random value between 1 and 6. A D2 is a regular D6 that is
        rolled but results of 1-3 gives the value 1 while 4-6 is the value 2. D3
        is a D6 where 1-2 is 1, 3-4 is 2 and 5-6 is 3. D6+1 means you roll as
        normal and add 1 to the result. 2D6 means you roll two dice.
      </p>
      <h3>Order Dice</h3>
      <p>
        Order dice are special six sided dice that are used to issue orders and
        not rolled. These dice have the 6 different orders on their sides
        instead of numbers. Each player should have different colored Order
        dice.
      </p>
      <h3>Dice Bag</h3>
      <p>
        Some kind of container to place the Order dice in is needed from which a
        random Order die can be drawn.{' '}

      <h2>Tokens</h2>
      <p>Some way to represent Pins on units and mark objectives is needed.</p>
